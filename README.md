# Feedback Modal Component

## The idea

The idea behind this project was to create a feedback modal that will aid in my future projects. The goal was for it to push the tickets a personal `Discord` channel. I wanted a way for future clients/testers to update me with their bugs, ideas or anything for the app this is will be attached to.

## Build with?

- React.js
- Discord webhook url

## The 3 navigation modals (Bug, Idea, Other)

### Bug

This modal includes a:

- Textarea: This will allow users to type in a message about a bug they are experiencing
- Severity filter: will allow users to select between low, medium, or high for the bug they are experiencing
- Assigned to: allow users to add their user name to the ticket returns anonymous if empty

### Idea

- Textarea: This will allow users to type in a message about an idea they would like to share
- Assigned to: allow users to add their user name to the ticket returns anonymous if empty

### Other (tell me anything)

- Textarea: This will allow users to type in a message they want to share with me
- Assigned to: allow users to add their user name to the ticket returns anonymous if empty
