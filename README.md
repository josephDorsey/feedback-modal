# Feedback Modal Component

## Build with?

- React.js
- Discord webhook url

## The idea

The idea behind this project was to create a feedback modal that will aid in my future projects.
It includes a bug, idea, and other (tell me anything) modal. I wanted a way for future clients/testers to update me with their bugs, ideas or anything for the app this is will be attached to.

## How to receive these tickets?

Each modal consists of a form that will be ported to my personal discord server. The form contents will create a body of text based on the content of the modal it is pushed from.
